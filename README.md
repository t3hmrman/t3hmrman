## Hi, I'm Victor  ðŸ‘‹

There are [yaks to shave](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) all over the stack, and I go where the yaks are.

I am currently in ( ðŸ—¼ Tokyo [x] | ðŸ¤  Austin [ ] )

Most of my projects and code are [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mrman), and I tweet at [@vadosware](https://twitter.com/vadosware)
