### Hi, I'm vados ðŸ‘‹

While other people were studying I got my degree in yak shaving. There are yaks all over the stack, and I go wherever the yaks are. In no particular order I'm interested in:

- Typescript (when I want to be productive)
- Rust (when I want to be fast)
- Haskell (when I want to be correct)
- Kubernetes
- Frontend "micro" frameworks (`lit-element`, `mithril`)
- Component frameworks (`svelte`,`vue`, `react`)

I keep [a technical blog](https://vadosware.io). Here are some ~~yak shaves~~ posts you might like that were recent the last time I updated this README:

I am currently in ( ðŸ—¼ Tokyo [x] | ðŸ¤  Austin [ ] )
Most of my projects and code are [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/mrman).
I have a twitter but I don't tweet or open twitter because it is a hellscape. [@vadosware](https://twitter.com/vadosware)
