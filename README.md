## Hi, I'm vados ðŸ‘‹

I am an expert yak shaver. There are yaks all over the stack, and I go wherever the yaks are. In no particular order I'm interested in:

- Typescript (when I want to be productive)
- Rust (when I want to be fast)
- Haskell (when I want to be correct)
- Kubernetes
- Frontend "micro" frameworks (`lit-element`, `mithril`)
- Component frameworks (`svelte`,`vue`, `react`)

### Products I'm working on

- [Unvalidated Startup/SaaS Ideas Newsletter](https://unvalidated-ideas.vadosware.io) - I bring the ideas, all you have to do is the market validation -- how hard could it be?
- [Waaard](https://waaard.com?ref=github) - Share links only your (customers | teammates | clients | friends) can open.
- [LoginWithHN](https://loginwithhn.com?ref=github) - An OAuth2+OpenID Connect provider for HackerNews, powered by [ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/)
